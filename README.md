# Group-3-Maze-Runner
 Final VR Project

This is a VR game for my course project

you start out at the entrance of the maze. Make sure you pick up the pistols and the timer and place them in your inventory sockets.

Once you click on start the zombies will start to spawn.

Escape the maze before the timer runs out.


There are many functionalities I wasn't able to add in this game (such as zombie attacking and damaging the player) due to time constraints.
